# Monster Master RPG Lore and Story Decisions

This document records accepted Monster Master RPG fiction, tone, character, and world decisions as they are made. It is intentionally built one bounded decision at a time. Unselected alternatives and speculative lore do not become canon merely because they were discussed.

## Decision 1 — Product tone and player role

Monster Master is a funny fantasy-adventure world where monster training is an established profession.

The player character is a human trainer and a full party member, not a monster or an off-screen commander. Trainers have archetypes, abilities, equipment, social roles, and meaningful participation in exploration and tactical combat. Depending on archetype, a trainer may fight beside called monsters, strengthen them, use ranged magic, heal, control positioning, or specialize in calling and managing a roster.

Monsters are distinct companions and combatants that trainers can call into battle. The exact calling method, relationship model, and roster rules remain undecided.

The comedy should be dry, situational, and frequently sardonic. The setting may contain danger, consequences, and sincere character moments, but it should not default to solemn mythological exposition, melodramatic fantasy terminology, constant slapstick, or self-aware parody.

### Implementation consequences

- Trainer and monster assets remain separate families.
- The current bootstrap presentation of the Master as a creature is not permanent lore.
- Future combat design must support active trainer archetypes rather than reducing every trainer to the same support unit.
- Future story and lore decisions should be presented in small, separately approvable slices.
